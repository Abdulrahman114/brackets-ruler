# Ruler for Brackets
An extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/) that adds
an adjustable column ruler to the editor.

This extension is still being built.  See the Roadmap section for more details.

### How to Install
1. Select **Brackets > File > Install Extension...**
2. Paste https://github.com/lkcampbell/brackets-ruler
into Extension URL field.
3. Click on the **Install** button.

### How to Use Ruler
Toggle the extension with **Brackets > View > Toggle Ruler** or use the
shortcut key which is **Ctrl-Alt-R** on Windows and **Command-Alt-R** on Mac.

Click, or click and drag, on the ruler to set a column guide at that point. Click
on the same point to remove the column guide.

### Known Issues

**CodeMirror Themes:** Officially, I'm only making sure the column ruler
works with the Default theme for Brackets. Unofficially, the ruler works
correctly with most of the other CodeMirror themes as well. Themes that
do not use the SourceCodePro font do not work correctly.  If you find
a bug with the ruler please make sure you can reproduce the bug while
using the Default theme before you open an issue on it.

### Roadmap

* Column guide
   * Create UI
      * Hook in Click event to toggle guide
      * Hook in Drag event to move guide left and right
  
* Nice But Not Necessary
   * Change CSS to LESS (proper namespacing of styles)
   * Update ruler when changing themes in Themes extension
   * Clean up ruler HTML-generator code using jQuery

### License

### Compatibility
Tested on Brackets Sprint 25 and later, Windows 7.
