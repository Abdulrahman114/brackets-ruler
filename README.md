# Ruler for Brackets
An extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/) that adds
an adjustable column ruler to the editor.

**WARNING:** This extension is in experimental mode and is not functional
at all. I am putting it on GitHub purely for my own convenience.  Please
do **not** install it or use it until I have made an announcement on the
Bracket-Dev Google Group that it is ready to use.

### How to Install
1. Select **Brackets > File > Install Extension...**
2. Paste https://github.com/lkcampbell/brackets-ruler
into Extension URL field.
3. Click on the **Install** button.

### How to Use Ruler
Toggle the extension with **Brackets > View > Toggle Ruler** or use the
shortcut key which is **Ctrl-Alt-R** on Windows and **Command-Alt-R** on Mac.
