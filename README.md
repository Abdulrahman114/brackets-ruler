# Ruler for Brackets
An extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/) that adds
an adjustable column ruler to the editor.

### How to Install
1. Select **Brackets > File > Extension Manager...**
2. Click on **Install from URL...**
3. Paste https://github.com/lkcampbell/brackets-ruler
into Extension URL field.
4. Click on the **Install** button.

### How to Use Ruler
Toggle the Column Ruler with **Brackets > View > Toggle Ruler** or use the
shortcut key which is **Ctrl-Alt-R** on Windows and **Command-Alt-R** on Mac.

Toggle the Column Guide with **Brackets > View > Toggle Column Guide** or
use the shortcut key which is **Ctrl-Alt-G** on Windows and **Command-Alt-G**
on Mac.

Clicking on the ruler set the guide at the column you click on.  If the guide is
already at the column you click on, the click will toggle the guide on and off.
Click and drag on the ruler to the set the column guide to a new column. Right
click on the ruler to get a context menu where you can toggle the guide or the
ruler.

### Known Issues

**CodeMirror Themes:** Officially, I'm only making sure the column ruler
works with the Default theme for Brackets. Unofficially, the ruler works
correctly with most of the other CodeMirror themes as well. Themes that
do not use the SourceCodePro font do not work correctly.  If you find
a bug with the ruler please make sure you can reproduce the bug while
using the Default theme before you open an issue on it.

When changing themes with the Themes extension, the ruler scroll does not
update.  Eventually, this will be addressed, but in the meantime, scroll
the editor to realign the ruler.

### Roadmap

Address the Ruler Length performance issues.  The typing speed gets slow when
the ruler is installed and text line start to get really long.  It is especially
bad with word wrapped files.

Short term solution: When word wrap is on, only grow the ruler to a max of, say,
200-300 columns, then turn off ruler update until the document is changed.

Longer term solution: Infinite ruler.  Instead of actually drawing a really long
ruler, just draw a ruler that dynamically updates its numbers as one edge scrolls
off the edge of the screen and the other edge scrolls on.
