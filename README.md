### Known Issues

**CodeMirror Themes:** Officially, I'm only making sure the column ruler
works with the Default theme for Brackets. Unofficially, the ruler works
correctly with most of the other CodeMirror themes as well. Themes that
do not use the SourceCodePro font do not work correctly.  If you find
a bug with the ruler please make sure you can reproduce the bug while
using the Default theme before you open an issue on it.
