### Unit Testing

### Known Issues

**Working with other extensions:** Any extensions that change the font family of
the editor (i.e. Themes, Fonts) from the default Brackets font of Source Code Pro
will make this extension act incorrectly, especially if the font is not monospace.
There is no good way to listen for font family change events right now in Brackets
or in CodeMirror, so I have to address these issues directly with the other extension
developers on a case-by-case basis.

### License
MIT-licensed -- see `main.js` for details.

### Compatibility
Tested on Brackets Sprint 39 and later, Mac OSX Mavericks.
